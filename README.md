# Handwritten Digit Recognition using PCA

This project implements a **handwritten digit recognizer** using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction, followed by machine learning models for classification. It uses the popular **MNIST dataset**, which contains 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## üìå Project Overview

The notebook demonstrates:

- Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset
- Applying PCA to reduce the feature space while retaining essential information
- Training classifiers (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.) on reduced data
- Evaluating model performance through accuracy scores and visual outputs

This approach highlights the importance of PCA in improving computational efficiency and performance when working with high-dimensional image data.
